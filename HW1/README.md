# Roomba for Mirrors and Windows
I am sure all of us have seen the marks formed by water on bathroom mirrors, shower glasses and windows. The marks are even more conspicuous if the water being used has higher total dissolved solids. Why not think of a device to clean the above mentioned glass surfaces.
## Keeping it simple and stupid.
I want to keep the first idea super simple and stupid. Drawing inspiration from the way glass exterior of high rise buildings are cleaned. The initial idea is to have a gantry robot which moves along the mirror while cleaning it. Mechanical and materials improvements like robot with suction wheels which can move like a spider can be thought of later.
